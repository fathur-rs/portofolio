Scraped over 20,000 tweets, including likes, retweet counts, quotes, tweet text, and usernames across diverse topics using Selenium to create a text dataset. Incorporated human and two pre-trained Indonesian text transformer sentiment analysis models (IndoBERT and IndoRoBERTa) for labeling 20,000 tweets text, with a final sentiment label determined using a voting mechanism. Achieved 93% accuracy in sentiment classification (negative, neutral, positive) by fine-tuning Distilled IndoBERT on labeled Indonesian tweets, resulting in 3x faster inferencing time and a 27% reduction in model size compared to other BERT models",
